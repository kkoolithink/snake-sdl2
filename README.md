# Snake (CURRENTLY HAS MODERATE GRAPHICAL BUG)

<p>This is a basic snake game coded in C using SDL2. I understand that SDL3 exists, but during the time of making this game I did not have access to it.</p>

# How to play

<p>On Linux, go to your Terminal (on Windows you need a Unix-like terminal; I don't care about Mac), go to the folder that contains the main.c file, then run the make command. It will create an executable that you can open and play Snake. If you want to play on Windows you will need to edit the makefile so that it compiles the C code into an executable compatible with Windows (do this by adding the .exe extension onto the output file). SDL2 is already inside the project so you don't need to install SDL2 onto your system.</p>
