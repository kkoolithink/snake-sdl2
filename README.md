# Snake (CURRENTLY HAS MODERATE GRAPHICAL BUG) (DISCONTINUED)
<hr>
<h3>If you want to play a better version of Snake that I made, look at my snake-sdl3 repository.</h3>
<hr>

<p>This is a basic snake game coded in C using SDL2. I understand that SDL3 exists, but during the time of making this game I did not have access to it. Downloading SDL2 is not required to run this program as the entire library is already inside this project.</p>

# How to play

<p>On Linux, go to your Terminal (on Windows you need a Unix-like terminal; I don't care about Mac), go to the folder that contains the main.c file, then run the make command. It will create an executable that you can open and play Snake. If you want to play on Linux you will need to edit the makefile so that it compiles the C code into a compatible executable (do this by removing the .exe extension from the output file).</p>
